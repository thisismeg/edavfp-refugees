***Syrian Civil War: Began March 15, 2011 (protests in Damascus) - today

***South Sudan: (i) Political unrest + (ii) famine  
	(i) Salva elected as president in 2011; accused VP of planning coup in 2013 and fired him; VP was brought back in 2015 thanks to internationally-brokered peace agreement but within months government collapsed
	(ii) famine, diseases -> ethnic unrest out of thin air; violence against women and children (majority of refugees) led to them fleeing the country
	tldr -> government collapse in 2015 but unrest began even earlier

***Afghanistan:
	1979-1989: Soviet Union occupies Afghanistam, pulls out in 1989
	1989-1992: War continued against the remnant of the Communist puppet regime; that government fell in 1992
	1992-1996:fighting between Muslim guerilla forces (using American weapons)
	1994 ~ Taliban emerged from refugee camps in Pakistan
	1996 - Taliban control most of the country & take capital (Kabul); ethnic cleansing of Shia minority
	2001 - NATO invades Afghanistan after 9/11, outed the Taliban government... some refugees returned
... violence persists because of lawlessness, abuse by authority (both NATO and Afghan security forces) and Taliban shadow state that still controls regions of Afghanistan... just a shit show that never ends
	2013 - NATO hands security command to Afghan army

***Dem. Rep. of the Congo: [p.s. there are 2 congos, we're interested in DR Congo]
	1960 - DR Congo wins independence from brutal Belgian rule; civil wars broke out after leftist was elected, overthrown and executed by rebels within months (with US and Belgian support)..... chaos and ar starts
	1965 - 1997 - Mobu took power, crushed dissent, corruption in government, opposed socialism and earned US aid in the process. But was abandoned after Cold War. Finally deposed by rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	1998- Laurent Kabila put in power and civil war ended; but within a year they (Rwanda, Uganda, Burndi) turned against him while Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent troops to defend him.... second civil war. 2001: Kabila assassinated, son Joseph takes over. 2002: stalemate -> peace treaties, transitional government under Joseph Kabila established.
	government didn't have power over many parts of the country and so different armed groups caused terror in civilians all over the country...
	2008 - Tutsis (rebels) stepped up intensity of attacks against government and Hutus... but were allowed to attack Hutu genocidaires in Congo and intensity decreases.... but more fightning by militias and gangs all over the place
	//..... basically government has no control and groups fight all over the place and displace people... diseases and refugees waiting for fighting to end so they can return home. Joseph Kabila still in power and control of capital but not of large parts of the country (he will not run for reelection in December 2018)

***Myanmar:
	Independence from Britain after WWII
	1949: rebellion by Christian Karen... still ongoing
	1962: first elected government overthrown by military coup, junta rule until 1988 (dissendents escaped)
	1988: peaceful protest movement by Buddhist monks... but army massacred protesters... new junta is even more repressive
	2007: another round of peaceful protests by Buddhists in 2007, crushed, after Hilary Clinton visited in 2011, social and political restraints were lifted and Burma opened up economically, sanctions lifted... but violence against Muslim Rohingya persists (government and majority of Burmese are Buddhist)
... mostly Muslims fleeing the country. 2016 - military and nationalist Buddhist were killing Rohingyas in a bout of ethnic cleansing.... fled to Bangladesh
